# LtiCoreToolRails

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add lti_core_tool_rails

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install lti_core_tool_rails

## Usage

This engine is to implement as much as possible of the [LTI Core 1.3](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/). The intent of this is to be a drop-in Rails engine to make building a LTI Core 1.3 application dead simple.

The need for this project stems from the [ims-lti](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) gem and the [lti_provider_engine](https://github.com/instructure/lti_provider_engine) engine. While those are decent starting points, they do not appear to implement the latest standards. This is a fresh implementation which will allow developers to use some or all relevant standards as needed.
